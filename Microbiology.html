<p style="color:white ; font-size:24"> Microbiology is the study of the biology of microscopic organisms - viruses, bacteria, algae, fungi, slime molds, and protozoa. The methods used to study and manipulate these minute and mostly unicellular organisms differ from those used in most other biological investigations. They are also the beauty behind nature, our chance of evolution. Microorganisms are part of Microbiology, therefore, is as central to the study of life as biochemistry, genetics, evolution, or molecular biology.<br><br>Microorganisms and their activities are critically important to virtually everything on Earth. Microorganisms matter because they affect every aspect of our lives â€“ they are in us, on us and around us</p>
<p style="color:white ; font-size:24">Microorganisms are also critical to a human's life because they help every part of our body, for instance: The stomach has many microorganisms that help separate the nutrients. Many plants as well are in great need of Microorganisms, rhizobacteria and mycorrhizae organisms. They can help improve stress tolerance by enhancing plant growth. Below are some microorganisms and some of ther descriptions.</p>

<tr>
<td style="border: 3px inset white; color:white ; font-size:20">Fungi</td>
<td style="border: 3px inset white; color:white ; font-size:20">Fungi is another form of microbiology that can be any form of mold. Fungi can include mold,  yeast, and mushrooms. They are some of the most important living microorganisms</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: 3px inset white; color:white ; font-size:20">Algae</td>
<td style="border: 3px inset white; color:white ; font-size:20">Algae is an informal term for a large and diverse group of photosynthetic, eukaryotic organisms. It is a polyphyletic grouping that includes species from multiple distinct clades.

<tr>
<td style="border: 3px inset white; color:white ; font-size:20">Bacteria
<td style="border: 3px inset white; color:white ; font-size:20">Bacteria are single celled organisms that live freely throughout nature. Bacteria are very small, normally they are only a few micro millimeters in length. They are also one of the first living things on earth.
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: 3px inset white; color:white ; font-size:20">Viruses
<td style="border: 3px inset white; color:white ; font-size:20">Viruses are microscopic germs that are contagious and dangerous. Viruses are dead, yet when entering the human being, they start to wake up. They as well infect other cells with their dna.
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: 3px inset white; color:white ; font-size:20"> Protozoa
<td style="border: 3px inset white; color:white ; font-size:20">Protozoa help carry out complex metabolic activities. Some protozoa have structures for other types of movement.

<p style="color:white ; font-size:24">This way, if we do not care more, the microorganisms will stop expanding in a variety of ranges. However, since many pollutants are cellular poisons infecting the world, it is not surprising to find that they also inhibit both microbial growth and activity. The organisms will stop expanding. We need to be sustainable to the environment, to save the microorganisms and our world.</p>
